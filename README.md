A 2d Game made with c# Using the Monogame Framework.

This Game is the Part 2 of the SkyScrapper(you can find the Part1
of this game in my github account) 

SkyScrapper part 1 was made in the python using pygame

The concept of the SkyScrapper2 is the same as that of the SkyScrapper1
only the game design is improved and some new addon is added.

And the last
but not the Least that the game is made in c# so you can expect for a
better game experience
